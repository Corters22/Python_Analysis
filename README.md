# Python_Challenge
Within this repository, there are two python codes. The first is "PyBank" which analyzes a simple csv file of banking data. The second is "PyPoll" which analyzes voting/poll information for a small town.

## Coding Instructions
  For both directories, you can find the code in the file "main.py". When running the code, you should be in the "PyBank" or "PyPoll" directory for the import/export paths to work. For reference, you can review the initial csv data file in the "Resources" file under their perspective directories.
